# 🧪 Multi-Armed Bandit Simulation for Product Recommendation Algorithms

This project simulates user interactions with product recommendation algorithms using **multi-armed bandit** strategies—**Thompson Sampling**, **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**, and **Random Selection**—to evaluate which algorithm drives more user engagement (clicks).

## 📌 Purpose

The goal is to simulate and analyze how different recommendation algorithms perform in driving user selections from various product divisions. It seeks to answer:
- Does the algorithm type affect user decisions?
- Is there a statistically significant difference in engagement between algorithms?

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The simulation comprises the following stages:

### 1. **Data Initialization**
- Reads product data from `Items_without_duplicates.csv`.
- Extracts product divisions (categories).
- Creates a list of `User` objects from a `user_data` class, initializing internal tracking for each algorithm.

### 2. **Trial Simulations**
For each algorithm:
- Runs multiple trials for each user.
- In each trial:
  - Recommends a division based on the algorithm.
  - Uses bias-based acceptance to simulate user behavior.
  - Updates internal tracking stats (clicks, impressions).

### 3. **Statistical Evaluation**
- Performs a **Chi-Squared Test** to assess if user engagement varies by algorithm.
- Conducts a **T-Test** to determine if there's a statistically significant difference in click rates between UCB and Thompson Sampling.

## 📊 Output

- Total clicks generated by each algorithm.
- `True/False` indicating whether the algorithm type significantly impacts user behavior.
- `True/False` indicating whether there's a significant difference between Thompson and UCB.

## 🔧 Key Components

- **`initialize_user_collection(...)`**: Initializes users for each algorithm group.
- **`generate_interaction_data_from_multiple_runs(...)`**: Simulates user trials and updates user state.
- **`check_if_algorithm_type_affects_user_decisions(...)`**: Chi-squared test for independence.
- **`check_for_significant_difference_between_clicks_due_to_algo_type(...)`**: T-test for difference of means.
